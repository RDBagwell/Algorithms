When you do this kind of custom creating, it&amp;rsquo;s important to use glass bottles, not plastic, so that the chemicals in plastic don&amp;rsquo;t get into the oil mixture. These amber glass bottles are ideal for all of your oil-mixing and cosmetic-creating needs. Made of amber-colored glass, they allow less light in than clear glass, allowing the contents of the bottles to stay pure for a longer period of time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The 1 oz. size is the perfect size to fit in your purse, backpack, or briefcase for more convenient travel.

The cards are meant to be a tool to help people integrate these oils into their everyday lives with ease. I put a lot of intentional energy into writing these cards. I spent time smelling each oil, did research on the meaning of each blend, and listened to what come into my mind naturally. It was a fun process and now it fees so good to add a sacred element to my day by applying an emotional oil and saying these affirming words. It's typically before meditating or when I just have 2 minutes of quiet time. Overall this practice has helped me become better at staying connected to myself.\"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</p>",

    "description": "<p>Aromatherapy, the fastest growing alternative healing method in the United States, is an effective and enjoyable way to find and maintain well-being. While its concepts are intuitive, few people realize that scientific proof exists for many of the uses of aromatherapy. In his book &ldquo;Advanced Aromatherapy&rdquo; author Kurt Schnaubelt, a chemist and pioneer of the science of aromatherapy, provides a scientific basis for the efficacy of essential oils, explained clearly and logically. &ldquo;Advanced Aromatherapy&rdquo; draws on broad-based research to demonstrate how Essential Oils interact with different systems of the body and how they affect emotional states as well as physical ones. It explains how to treat symptoms ranging from hay fever to stress disorders with predictable results. Students of aromatherapy wishing to take their practice to the next level will find that much of the guesswork used in developing formulas is no longer necessary. Professional aromatherapists will find that &ldquo;Advanced Aromatherapy&rdquo; turns the art of healing with Essential Oils into good medicine for the next century.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong><em>&nbsp;Overview of Topics:</em></strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Aromatherapy: A Challenge to Conventional Medicine</li>\r\n<li>Essential Oils: Definition and Distillation</li>\r\n<li>The Effects of Essential Oils</li>\r\n<li>Self-Treatment with Essential Oils</li>\r\n<li>Choosing Essential Oils</li>\r\n<li>Application of Essential Oils</li>\r\n<li>Aromatherapy: Mediating Between the Immune System, Emotions and the Body</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong><em>&nbsp;Product Details:</em></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Pages: 138</p>\r\n<p>Chapters: 7</p>\r\n<p>Published: 1998</p>\r\n<p>Size: 8&rdquo; x 10&rdquo; x .5&rdquo;</p>",

Whether you use a single oil, an oil blend, or your favorite massage oil, the roll-on tops allow you to apply the oil directly where you want it and do so evenly and smoothly. Best of all, these roll-on bottles are easy to use: Simply add oil blends to the bottle using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.discoverlsp.com/bottles/dispensing-tools.html\">glass dropper or pipette</a>, snap the roll-on ball to the top, and roll away your aches, worries, and stresses. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><em><strong>What&rsquo;s Included:</strong></em></span>&nbsp;Three 10 ML glass roll-on bottles with steel balls.

    "description": "<p>Jojoba oil is technically not really an oil at all. It&rsquo;s a liquefied form of vegetable wax that comes from the nuts and seeds of the jojoba plant, an evergreen shrub that grows in hot desert areas. Because it&rsquo;s colorless, odorless, and has a smooth viscosity, it is perfect for use as a carrier. Due to the natural vitamins and minerals present, it stays fresh much longer than other oils without going rancid. It&rsquo;s mild nature also makes it nearly hypoallergenic so it&rsquo;s suitable for even the most sensitive skin.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><em><strong>&nbsp;What&rsquo;s Included:</strong></em></span> 1 6-ounce bottle of 100% pure, cold expeller-pressed jojoba oil</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><em><strong>&nbsp;Size:</strong></em></span> 1.75&rdquo; Diameter x 6.25&rdquo; Height</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><em><strong>&nbsp;How to Use:</strong></em></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Dispense directly from the bottle, or use our apothecary-style droppers to measure exact amounts into the glassware of your choosing.
